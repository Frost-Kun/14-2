## **🚀 Respect Open-Source**
I built this for **fun & learning**. If you fork or modify it:  
✔ **Use it for creativity, personal projects, or learning**  
✔ **Give proper credit when using it in public**  
✔ **Respect the original creator’s work**  
❌ **DO NOT try to profit from free content**  

## ** I won't sell it **


## How It Works 

This project consists of a simple webpage with a "CÓ" and "KHÔNG" button. When the user clicks the "KHÔNG" button, the button text changes to a series of  messages, and the "CÓ" button grows larger. If the user clicks the "CÓ" button, they are redirected to a new page (`yes_page.html`).

### Features:
- **Interactive Buttons**: The "KHÔNG" button cycles through , while the "CO" button grows in size.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to work on all screen sizes.
